# Reporting analysis with Rmarkdown and GitHub

## Rmarkdown & GitHub

- Rmarkdown creates dynamic reports in HTML, PDF, and Word
- Combine text (using the markdown language) and R code
- Rmarkdown runs R code, compiles, and produces a report in chosen format
- This presentation was created using Rmarkdown!

## Exercises in R

1) Open the `day4_Rmd-datamanip1_exercises.Rmd`
2) Save as: `Day4Exercise_LastnameFirstname.Rmd` within the `submissions` folder
3) Read in the gapminder data set
4) As you answer questions, be sure to annotate your work with as much detail as possible!
5) At the end of the day, we'll push it over to MSiA

# RMD 

>- If you're familiar with LaTex, Rmarkdown (RMD) uses most of the same syntax you're used to when writing in Latex
>- RMD documents have two major components: The written text and the code
>- This means you can write up analyses and insert figures and tables in the same document! 
>- It does mean that there are special codes requires to be able to do this, however
>- Basically the R script is the scratch paper and the RMD is where you put your final code and analysis into one document 

## RMD Codes 

>- The white spaces in RMD look similar to the script, however the white spaces will not run code; they are used to write out sentences like analyses, document headings, etc... 
>- To work with code, you must initiate a chunk via \`\`\`\{r\} and end it with \`\`\`

## Useful specifications, example

## Knitting 

As you work through your file, you can knit it to different formats in order to see what it looks like. Ultimately you can share the output as a document or memo. 

- knit to pdf requires Latex
- knit options are specified manually when pressing the arrow next to knit

# Advanced data manipulation, part 1: reshaping and merging

Let's get set up!

## A new dataset

California energy data

- file names: `ca_energy_generation.csv` and `ca_energy_imports.csv`
- Read these two files into your working environment
    - They are in the "data" folder

## Reading in the data

```{r importing, warning=F, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
generation <- read_csv("../data/ca_energy_generation.csv")
imports <- read_csv("../data/ca_energy_imports.csv")
```

## Tidy data: What the heck is the `tidyverse`?

>- “System of packages for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization that share a common design philosophy” - Rickert
>- Mainly developed by Hadley Wickham 
>- These packages work together using consistent language structures—once you learn it, these packages will feel as one

## Tidy data: Tidyverse packages 

![packages included in the tidyverse, always adding new packages](figures/tidyverse universe.png)

## What is Tidy Data?

>- "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way" - Leo Tolstoy 
>- "Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way" - Hadley Wickham
>- Basically, tidy data are the way your data should be organized 

## Three rules for tidy data:

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell. 

## 1. Each variable must have its own column 

![variables to column](figures/variables to column.png)

## 2. Each observation must have its own row

![observations to row](figures/observations to row.png)

## 3. Each value must have its own cell. 

![values to cell](figures/values to cell.png)

## Long to wide 

![long to wide](figures/long to wide.png)

## Wide versus long data

- Often, we want to make wide data long (or tidy) for analysis

![Wide to long](figures/wide to long.png)

## Wide versus long data

```{r wide data}
head(generation)
```


## Using `reshape2`

- `gather` --> make data long
- `spread` --> make data wide

## Reshaping CA energy data

- Right now, the `generation` dataframe has several observations per row

```{r untidy data}
head(generation)
```

## `gather` the generation data

`gather(df, key = new column name for key variable, value = new column name for data)`

- Specify the variable that _doesn't_ gather through `-variable` (or specify the ones you want to gather)

```{r gather}
long_gen <- gather(generation, key = source, value = usage, -datetime)
head(long_gen)
```

## reordering the `gather` the generation data by time

```{r reordering}
head(long_gen[order(long_gen$datetime), ])
```

```{r}
spread(long_gen, key = source, value = usage) %>% slice(1:5)
```

# Dealing with dates/time
How the heck am I supposed to work with "2019-09-03 00:00:00"?

## Dealing with dates and times

- Notice that the first variable in both dataset is the called "datetime"
- What class are these variables?

```{r}
class(generation$datetime)
class(imports$datetime)
```




## Dealing with dates/times: `lubridate`

- The best way to deal with date-time data is to use the `lubridate` package
- You can convert character variables into datetime format using the `as_datetime` function
    - One advantage of `readr::read_csv` is that it will often detect and convert datetime variables when importing

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
library(lubridate)
```

## Dealing with dates/times with `lubridate`
```{r datetime}
generation$datetime <- as_datetime(generation$datetime)
head(generation$datetime)
```


```{r}
imports$datetime <- as_datetime(imports$datetime)
head(imports$datetime)
```

# Merging data

## Merging CA energy data

- Sometimes you have data from two (or more) sources that you want to analyze 
- Need to merge these dataframes together
- To merge, need to chose the columns that have common values between the dataframes
  - Usually a variable with ids or years, or both
  
## Merging the `merge`

`merge(x, y, by = c("id", "year"))`

- Key arguments: 
  - `x`: first dataframe
  - `y`: second dataframe
  - `by`: variables to match (must have common name)

## More `merge` arguments

```{r, eval = F}
merge(x, y, by.x = "id", by.y = "cd", all.x = T, all.y = T)
```

- Advanced arguments:
  - Use `by.x` and `by.y` if the dataframes have different variable names
  - Use `all.x = T` if you want to keep all the observation in the first dataframe (unmatched observations in `y` are dropped!)
  - Use `all.y = T` if you want to keep all observations in the second dataframe (umatched observations in `x` are dropped!)
  - Use both (or, simply `all = T`) to keep all observations!
  - By **default** R will drop unmatched observations from **both** dataframes!

## Merge by `datetime`

- Use `merge` to join the `generation` and `imports` dataframes, using the `datetime` variable to match

## Merge by `datetime`

- Always check your merge!

```{r merge}
merged_energy <- merge(generation, imports, by = "datetime")
dim(merged_energy)
head(merged_energy)
```

## Try reshaping the merged data!

- Our merged dataframe is still wide and untidy
  - Create a long version called `long_merged_energy`
  - Take a peek to make sure the long version looks correct

## Try reshaping the merged data!

```{r gather exercise}
long_merged_energy <- gather(merged_energy, key = source, value = usage, -datetime)
head(long_merged_energy)
```
