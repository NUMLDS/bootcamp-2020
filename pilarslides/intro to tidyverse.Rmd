# Intro to Tidyverse 

A combination of packages that are useful for: importing, cleaning and transforming, processing and analyzing, visualizing. 

Most common packages: dplyr, ggplot, haven 

When you install (and load) tidyverse, you're installing (and loading) all of these packages. You can, instead, load the individual packages you'll use.

# Tidy Data

.med[There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:]

--

.med[1) Each variable must have its own column] 

.center[
```{r  out.height="40%", out.width="50%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/vars.png") 
```
]

# Tidy Data

.med[There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:]

--

.med[2) Each observation must have its own row.] 

.center[
```{r  out.height="40%", out.width="50%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/rows.png") 
```
]

# Tidy Data

.med[There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:]

--

.med[3) Each value must have its own cell.] 

.center[
```{r  out.height="40%", out.width="50%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/cells.png") 
```

# Dplyr 

.med[Dplyr is a package for *data manipulation*.] 

--

.med[It's intuitive. Check out it's basic commands and guess what each does:] 

--
.med[.pull-left[
1) mutate 

2) select

3) filter

4) summarize/summarise

5) group_by

6) rename
]]

.pull-right[
```{r  out.height="60%", out.width="60%", echo=FALSE}

# Dplyr In Practice: exploring dataset

.med[Let's use the data on Chicago neighborhoods.]

```{r}
chicago <- read.csv("data/Census Data_selected_2008-2012.csv")
```

.large[Check out the 'glimpse' command. How does it compare to the Base R commands we learned last time? (dim(), head(), and names() ?]

---
# Dplyr in Practice: renaming

.med[Notice the variable names are quite messy. Let's fix this with 'rename'.]

```{r echo=T, results="hide"}
rename(chicago, neighborhood=COMMUNITY.AREA.NAME)
```
--

.med[Let's check if this worked:]

```{r}
names(chicago)
```
--

.med[How come?]

---
# PRACTICE

.med[Rename the following variables:] 

<br> 
 
.med[1) PERCENT.HOUSEHOLDS.BELOW.POVERTY into "poverty"]
  
  <br>
  
.med[2) PERCENT.AGED.25..WITHOUT.HIGH.SCHOOL.DIPLOMA into "no_diploma".]

--
```{r echo=FALSE}
chicago <-
  chicago %>% rename(diploma = PERCENT.AGED.25..WITHOUT.HIGH.SCHOOL.DIPLOMA,
                     poverty = PERCENT.HOUSEHOLDS.BELOW.POVERTY,
                     neighborhood = COMMUNITY.AREA.NAME) 
```
---
# Dplyr in Practice: summarizing

.med[`summarize` reduces observations to a single value based on functions]

```{r}
summarise(chicago, mean = mean(poverty))
```
--

Let's add other descriptive statistics:

```{r}
summarise(chicago, mean = mean(poverty), sd = sd(poverty), max = max(poverty))
```


---
# Dplyr in Practice: filtering

Say we want to create a filter to get neighborhoods that have poverty rates above 20%. 

If we run this command, it will simply show us the dataset with the filter.
```{r eval=FALSE}
filter(chicago, poverty > 20)
```
--

We can save this new dataset as a new object:

```{r}
high_pov <- filter(chicago, poverty > 20)
```
--
You can combine multiple conditions too: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
filter(chicago, poverty > 20 & diploma > 40 & neighborhood != "Hermosa")
```

---
# PRACTICE 

.med[ 1) What are the dimensions of this new dataset? 

2) Summarize 'poverty' on this new dataset]

---
# Dplyr in Practice: selecting

.med[Sometimes you will be working with large dataset that have hundreds of variables. But what if you want to work with only some of these variables?]

--

.med[We can create a dataset that has only the variables we want:]

```{r}
small_chicago <- select(chicago, poverty, diploma, neighborhood)
```
--

```{r}
glimpse(small_chicago)
```
---
# Dplyr in Practice: selecting 

.med[
- select by name: 
  - `select(chicago, poverty, diploma)`
- select by position: 
  - `select(chicago, c(1, 3, 10))`
- select by range:
  - `select(chicago, neighborhood:poverty)` or `select(chicago, 1:3)`
- drop variables with `-`
  - `select(chicago, -diploma)`
- "select helpers" that make subsetting variables very easy
  - `one_of()`, `contains()`, `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, `matches()`
]

---
# Dplyr in Practice: grouping 

Many times you'll want to analyze data across groups (regions, gender, age group, political party, etc.). We can use the group_by function for this. 

```{r}
grouping <- group_by(chicago, ZONE)
```

And now instead of summarizing over "chicago", we summarize over the new object "grouping". 

```{r}
summarise(grouping, mean = mean(poverty))
```

---
# Dplyr in Practice: Pipes %>% 

.med[There's a wonderful tool in dplyr called a **pipe**, which will allow us to do things much more efficiently.]

--

.center.med[It's symbols is %>% *(tip: keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+M)*]

--

.med[
- It lets us perform multiple operations at once, without creating an object for each one of them.
- It sends the result of one function to another function
- Read `%>%` as "then"
- `%>%` increases the readability of your code]


---
# Dplyr in Practice: Pipes %>% 

Let's take the example above (mean of poverty by area) and do it in one step. The first thing we do is tell it which dataset we want to run the commands in, and then we simply write the commands, without having to specify the dataset. 

--

```{r}
chicago %>% group_by(ZONE) %>% summarise(mean = mean(poverty))
```
--

This translates to: in the dataset 'chicago', group by 'zone' and give us the mean of poverty for each zone. 

---
# Dplyr in Practice: Pipes

You can add as many commands as you want (but nothing in excess is good!). 

--

```{r}
chicago %>% select(poverty, ZONE) %>% filter(poverty > 30) %>% 
  group_by(ZONE) %>% summarise(mean = mean(poverty))
```

--

In this case, we are first selecting only two variables from the dataset, then filtering for neighborhoods with poverty rates over 30%, then grouping by zone, then obtaining the mean poverty rate for each zone.
